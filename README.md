##Bank Account Kata##

As a exercise of the BootCamp with Factor√≠a F5, we continue with our aproach to the TESTs TDD environment. Bank Account Kata is a code-gamePlay based on the TDD principles:
  1. Test Fails
  2. Test Passes
  3. Refactor

Test consists in covering the next points with Java Code within Intellij:
Create an account with an initial balance of $1000.
Deposit $500 into the account.
Withdraw $200 from the account.
Check the current balance (it should be $1300).
Attempt to withdraw $1500 (this should fail because the available balance is $1300).
Check the current balance again (it should still be $1300).
